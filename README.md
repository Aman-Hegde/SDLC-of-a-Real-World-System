# Branching Strategy

The main branch contains the stable version of the project report. A separate branch was created to work on updates and improvements to the documentation. Once the revisions were completed and reviewed, the changes were merged back into the main branch.

This approach helps in understanding basic version control concepts such as branching, merging, and document versioning, even in a documentation-based project without source code.
